Pygame Package - Overview ðŸŽ®
Pygame is a cross-platform Python library used for developing 2D games and multimedia applications. It provides modules for handling graphics, sound, input events, and physics, making game development easier.

ðŸ”¹ Features of Pygame
Easy to Use â€“ Simple API with built-in support for game loops, event handling, and rendering.
Cross-Platform â€“ Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Hardware Acceleration â€“ Uses SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) for fast performance.
Supports Sound & Music â€“ Can play MP3, OGG, WAV files.
Handles Input Events â€“ Supports keyboard, mouse, and joystick inputs.
